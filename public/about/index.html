    <p>Hey, my name is Ben, also known as &ldquo;highjack&rdquo; online. I&rsquo;ve been interested in computers since the age of 6 when my parents brought me an Amiga 500. I like to break things, it&rsquo;s not a hobby, it&rsquo;s a passion, it&rsquo;s what I do inside and outside of work and I can&rsquo;t see that ever changing. I&rsquo;m addicted to hacking. I can&rsquo;t stop myself but to prod and poke things, figure out how they work and then try and get them to do stuff they aren&rsquo;t meant to do.</p>
<p>I specialise in testing web apps which stems from the first scripting language I ever properly learnt which was PHP. After Uni I worked as a PHP developer for a couple of years but security has always been my where my heart it. So the obvious path for me was to learn about web app security.</p>
<p>I also venture off into many other areas of security. I like playing with exploit development, I can manage stack based buffer overflows, format string issues and have built a few ROP chains but I still struggle with heap overflows. I&rsquo;m not the best reverse engineer but I will give it a good go and I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m medicore at &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; network pentesting/red teaming, I certainly know enough to get by, meaning I&rsquo;m probably on par with some of the APT groups but I think the &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; part of the acronym  is often debatable based on some of the write ups I&rsquo;ve read. I mean I get it, if there is a super easy way to get a shell why would you bother with anything else. Not that I condone that sort of behavior ;)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get into bug bounties recently but my free time is quite limited out of work if I find anything cool I will post it. Don&rsquo;t worry I won&rsquo;t be posting poor quality write ups just to show you how much money I&rsquo;ve made. I&rsquo;m trying to shoe horn some automated recon system using kubernetes currenly and when it is in some kind of operational order I will share it online. I don&rsquo;t mind recon, but I&rsquo;m more of a deep dive kind of guy.</p>
<p>My blog just contains a few old CTF write ups for now but I plan on working on it, to include many of the topics that I am interested in. There&rsquo;s some links to some old vulnerabilities I have reported too, I haven&rsquo;t done this in a good while, a certain company that I won&rsquo;t name threatened me to throw me in jail for writing a blog post (after a fix was available) because they wanted to silently patch it and not make the customer&rsquo;s aware of the issue.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not doing this for money or fame, it&rsquo;s mostly just a scratch pad for me to dump my findings on but if even just one person out there learns something from my content then that&rsquo;s an added bonus.</p>
